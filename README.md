Heya, I'm Katini, or Agapurnis, or Vak#1415, or one of many other names. I go by any pronouns.

I'm a moderately experienced TypeScript developer who's currently learning Rust.

I've been programming for quite a while, but I’m pretty much entirely self-taught through documentation and don't really have any formal education or work experience with programming, so sorry if I end up doing something foolish.

Technically I'm a "fullstack developer", but I'm pretty mediocre on both ends, usually working on libraries somewhere in the middle that never end up getting published.

I'm rather lackluster at using Git or communicating due to my habit of overthinking and social anxiety, so apologies if I'm slow to act or end up editing my message (which would already be revised a concerning amount of time) multiple times to ensure there's no misunderstandings.

Recently I've been interested in working in 'limited' environments, where I have to work within weird confines and do optimizations, creating abstractions so that I can continue building off of what I have.

That might lead me to eventually checking out making myself a (mediocre) compiler of some sort (I'll get you someday, [KCUF](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59f9cad032b8b91e12000035/javascript)...),
but in reality it's assisting with my habit of (ab)using the TypeScript type system to make abhorrently weird things or overcomplicate simple things so much that the restrictions imposed make it impossible to safely extend, thus restarting the cycle.

You can contact me at [agapurnis@outlook.com](mailto:agapurnis@outlook.com), but I rarely (read: nev‧er) ever check it, so you'll probably need to use Discord to friend + message `Vak#1415`.
